This motivates the farmers to plant coffee shade trees and bee forage species, integrating trees into their farms. So far, 734 trees have been planted and marked on the GainForest Green Globe. The trees contribute to land and habitat restoration, mitigate climate change and prevent landslides. At the same time honey and coffee sales provide additional income to the farmers; while the bees enhance food production and biodiversity through pollination.The social enterprise also purchases coffee grown under agroforestry at premium prices, further motivating farmers to integrate and preserve trees on their farms.",

The situation has particularly impacted their children, who must endure a six-hour walk under the scorching sun to reach school. In response, Gainforest and Oya Institute have partnered with the community to launch a fundraising campaign aimed at constructing an artesian well and purchasing a quad bike. These solutions would provide reliable access to clean water and safer transportation, helping the community maintain their traditional way of life while building resilience against the increasing challenges of climate change. The campaign seeks donations and social sharing to support these vital infrastructure improvements that would significantly impact the daily lives of community members.",

At the Lenkobei site, one of four sites across 80 hectares, 20 women are actively involved in cultivating and harvesting native grasses to reseed overgrazed lands, revitalizing grazing areas, and strengthening ecosystem health. So far, the initiative has restored over 80 acres, ensuring sustainable pastoralism and wildlife coexistence. Beyond ecological impact, the seed banks generate income that supports families and funds school bursaries, fostering long-term community resilience. By combining restoration with economic empowerment, SORALO is securing a healthier future for both people and nature.",

Oceanus trained 11 local surveyors to use smartphones for data collection, replacing traditional pen-and-paper methods. Combining their local knowledge with technology, the surveyors documented 600 mangrove trees, recording species, diameter at breast height (DBH), height, GPS coordinates, and photos of tree barks, leaves, flowers, and fruits. These parameters are key in determining the carbon potential of each tree. The surveyors collectively earned 40 pesos per tree, providing a form of supplemental livelihood. A total of 48,000 pesos was distributed through two wallet accounts managed by field officers, who facilitated cash withdrawals and ensured transparent payment distribution. By integrating local expertise with technology, the project provided exposure to digital tools and actively involved communities in mangrove conservation efforts.",
